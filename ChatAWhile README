This is a small program that asks a user to enter an area code.
If the area code exists in an array, the user is asked to enter the number of minutes a call to 
that area code will be. The user will see how much the call will cost. The user can continue entering 
area codes until they quit.

The working area codes are: 262, 414, 608, 715, 815, 920.
