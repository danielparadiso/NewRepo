JUst to see if i'm doing this right

A very simple program, a question in a textbook. 
The object is to have the user enter a zip code. The zip code will be searched in an array.
If the zip code is found, the user will know what the delivery charge to that zip code is.
If the zip code is not found, it will let the user know, that it is not there.
The program will loop until the user quits.

The working zip codes are:  12321, 23432, 34543, 45654, 56765, 67876, 78987, 89098, 90109, 01210
